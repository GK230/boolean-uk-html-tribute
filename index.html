      <p class="to-letter">Dear Anna Karenina,</p>
      <p class="main-letter">
        I love you, you are my favourite novel, even though I have never read
        you! However, I have watched you in your various forms: the classic
        starring Greta Garbo, my favourite starring Sean Bean and Sophie
        Marceau, and even when you were a modern version set in Australia, I
        still adored you. You have been described acurtely I belive, as the
        greatest novel ever written, and somewhat disparagingly, in my opinion,
        as the ultimate relationship drama.
      </p>
      <p class="main-letter">
        I am currently trying to appreciate your natural beauty by reading you
        in Russian, even though it takes me an hour to read about two pages
        using the Collins Russian-English dictionary app. Nevertheless from the
        first sentence I managed to decipher, I realised you are
        <em>actually</em> amazing, just as I always felt you were.
